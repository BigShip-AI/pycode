Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the U.S. - Statistics & Facts | Statista,"Jul 19, 2021","
        Artificial intelligence (AI), the technology that allows digital computers or computer-controlled robots to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings, has been the subject of people’s imagination for decades. Although human-like androids such as those portrayed in the science fiction movie Blade Runner are still far from reality, applications of AI such as smartphone virtual assistants and industrial robots are already widespread in our society and make our life more convenient. Given AI’s powerful ability to improve efficiency and increase productivity, it is of strategic importance to countries and governments that are competing to get ahead in the AI race. The United States, being the only superpower in the world, is naturally advantaged in this race and has been in the lead.
